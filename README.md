üöÄ Quick Start Guide
1. Dependencies Installation
For Windows:
You'll need the following tools installed on your machine:

PowerShell
NVIDIA CUDA
OpenSSL
CMake
Visual Studio Build Tools
Run the following commands in an Admin PowerShell window to install dependencies:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# Install CUDA
winget install -e --id NVIDIA.CUDA

# Install OpenSSL
winget install -e --id OpenSSL.OpenSSL

# Install CMake
winget install -e --id Kitware.CMake

# Install Visual Studio Build Tools
winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended"
For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    nvidia-cuda-toolkit \
    nvidia-driver-535 \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    libboost-all-dev \
    cmake \
    git \
    ocl-icd-opencl-dev
2. Installation
Step 1 - Clone the Repository:
First, clone the CrackBit repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/crackbit/crackbit.git
cd crackbit
Step 2 - Build with CUDA Optimization:
Create the build directory and compile the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release -j$(nproc)
Step 3 - Create Launchers:
For Linux: Create a launcher script:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo '#!/bin/sh
cd "$(dirname "$0")/build"
./CrackBit "$@"' > ../CrackBit.sh
chmod +x ../CrackBit.sh
For Windows: Create a Launch.bat file:

batch
Copy
Edit
@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0build\Release"
CrackBit.exe %*
pause
3. Usage
Basic Scanning:
To start solving a Bitcoin puzzle, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
./CrackBit.sh --range 9A --puzzle 68
Key Features:
Auto-Resume: Progress is saved every 30 seconds in checkpoint.dat.
Multi-GPU: Distribute the load across multiple GPUs using the --gpus option. Example: --gpus 0,1,2.
Real-Time Stats: Get live monitoring with a built-in dashboard.
4. Advanced Configuration
You can customize CrackBit's behavior by editing the settings.txt file:

ini
Copy
Edit
[GPU]
# 0 = Auto-optimize
threads = 0  
# 2-8 character hex prefix
target = 9A1F

[Performance]
# Keys per GPU batch (default: 1e8)
batch_size = 100000000

[Output]
log_level = detailed
results_file = found.txt
Command Reference:
Option	Description
--range XX	Specify a 2-digit hex starting prefix.
--puzzle N	Select puzzle number (68-75).
--benchmark	Run performance tests.
--api 8080	Enable REST API on port 8080.
--telegram	Connect Telegram bot for notifications.
5. Performance Tuning
Optimal Settings by GPU Model:
GPU Model	Threads	Batch Size	Expected Speed
RTX 4090	1024	1e8	42.6B keys/s
RTX 3090	896	7.5e7	31.2B keys/s
RTX 2080 Ti	768	5e7	18.4B keys/s
Auto-Tune for Your Hardware:
CrackBit can automatically optimize settings for your GPU:

bash
Copy
Edit
./CrackBit.sh --optimize
‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Compliance

‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: Can I use AMD GPUs?
No, CrackBit currently only supports NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 20xx/30xx/40xx) for CUDA acceleration.

Q: How do I pause and resume the process?
Simply press CTRL+C to stop and save progress. When you relaunch CrackBit, it will resume from where it left off.

Q: Why are the speeds slower than expected?
Use the --benchmark command to verify your CUDA and driver versions. Ensure your hardware is optimized for maximum performance.
